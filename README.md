# Drought monitoring using precipitation and temperature time series data in Google Earth Engine
This project details how to assess vegetation health as a proxy for agricultural drought using Vegetation Health Index (VHI). VHI is obtained by the sum of Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI). I used MODIS NDVI dataset to compute VCI and MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) to compute TCI in Google Earth Engine.
